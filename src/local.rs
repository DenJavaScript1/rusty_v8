/// An object reference managed by the v8 garbage collector.
///
/// All objects returned from v8 have to be tracked by the garbage
/// collector so that it knows that the objects are still alive.  Also,
/// because the garbage collector may move objects, it is unsafe to
/// point directly to an object.  Instead, all objects are stored in
/// handles which are known by the garbage collector and updated
/// whenever an object moves.  Handles should always be passed by value
/// (except in cases like out-parameters) and they should never be
/// allocated on the heap.
///
/// There are two types of handles: local and persistent handles.
///
/// Local handles are light-weight and transient and typically used in
/// local operations.  They are managed by HandleScopes. That means that a
/// HandleScope must exist on the stack when they are created and that they are
/// only valid inside of the HandleScope active during their creation.
/// For passing a local handle to an outer HandleScope, an EscapableHandleScope
/// and its Escape() method must be used.
///
/// Persistent handles can be used when storing objects across several
/// independent operations and have to be explicitly deallocated when they're no
/// longer used.
///
/// It is safe to extract the object stored in the handle by
/// dereferencing the handle (for instance, to extract the *Object from
/// a Local<Object>); the value will still be governed by a handle
/// behind the scenes and the same rules apply to these values as to
/// their handles.
///
/// Note: Local handles in Rusty V8 differ from the V8 C++ API in that they are
/// never empty. In situations where empty handles are needed, use
/// Option<Local>.
