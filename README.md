# rusty_v8

[![Build Status](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8/workflows/ci/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8/actions)

This is a project to replace libdeno with a full V8 binding. It's very much
under construction and not usable. I'll update this message if it ever is.
